I’m posting this because I did not know this exact rule about interpolation and maybe others didn’t. TL;dr If you are a songwriter because someone interpolates your song you do not get a Grammy award. You get a certificate.

If Olivia Rodrigo's SOUR is nominated for Album of the Year at the #GRAMMYs, Taylor will not receive the nomination since New Years Day counts as an interpolation track and only songwriters of new songs receive the award.	获奖颁奖
