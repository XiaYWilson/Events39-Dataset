Labour calling on @DominicRaab to resign is the most hypocritical thing. Why didn't Starmer resign when they used Indian Prime Minister Modi on a Labour By-election flyer as a deterrent to voting for the Tories? Surely that's an insult to Foreign Relations with a major partner	辞职
Yes ; If it turns out @GovKathyHochul knew about the nursing home death coverup and she continues to ignore Howard Zucker’s role in that tragedy then she needs to resign as well.	辞职

Trump won 2020! ; BREAKING🚨 President Donald Trump calls on Joe Biden to “resign in disgrace.”	辞职
In fairness, Milley could only focus on only one people's rage at a time. That'd be the American people's white rage ; - they should be fired or forced to resign. A great General in the field should resign the day he turns into a politician in D.C. Milley and Austin preceded President Biden in May dismissing what they called hypothetical implausible scenarios.	辞职

Remember when Covid struck and Trump admin helped people come home to #USA? Different world with an uncaring so called President ; Biden is charging Americans up to $2,000+ for flights home from Afghanistan. He has the money for his $3,500,000,000,000 socialist budget, but not to help our fellow Americans he abandoned in Afghanistan? It's time for Biden to resign.	辞职
#COVID19au Resign @ScottMorrisonMP Go to the GG & call an #election. ; We’ve got a Health Minister who’s been pushed to one side and replaced by a General, we don’t have enough supply, and we’ve got an endless debate about the nature of lockdowns. #auspol	辞职

@JoeBiden Shut up and resign already. Fake president.	辞职
Facts ; Retired right-wing generals are coming out of the woodworks calling on Biden and members of his Cabinet to resign after evacuating from Afghanistan. These war hawks are part of a lobbying initiative to sacrifice humans for their own personal profit. Don't trust a word they say.	辞职
If he doesn’t want to hear blip , then he needs to resign because Biden is president and you are nothing ! ; Someday he'll be a blip in the history books as 1 of the worse Governor's this country has ever seen.

"QT @kylegriffin1: Good. Now #FireDeJoy ; President Biden has fired Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul, a Trump appointee, after he refused to resign from the post. Biden also asked for the resignation of David Black, the agency's deputy commissioner, who did resign. "	辞职

There are going to be more questions like this now that Biden has called for Cuomo to resign and I don't think anyone will have an answer for it.

Biden's former senate aide Tara Reade accused him of sexual assault...Should there be an independent investigation of allegations into the president as there was into Governor Cuomo?	辞职
The fact that @tito_mboweni was overpowered to make the public sector wage deal happen is very telling. When your finance Minister loses control of the purse strings you should be concerned. He should resign, they’re using him as a figurehead.	辞职
This is no laughing matter! Incompetent! ; NEW: The President of the United States is joking about the crisis in Afghanistan while Americans and our allies are still stranded.

Huge setback for the @vijayanpinarayi at the Supreme Court. The SC rejected the govt's petition seeking the withdrawal of the 2015 Assembly violence case against LDF MLAs. Minister C.Shivankutty is no longer qualified to hold the constitutional office. He should resign.	辞职
