On Chinese orbital bombardment system glider test, relevant to remind that INDOPACOM last year projected China by mid-2020s would have 50 ICBMs and 75+ IRBM/MRBMs with “hypersonics.” All ICBM payloads are hypersonic so probably implies glider of some sort. ; Chinese leadership must be really worried about the US missile defense system since they go through the trouble of developing Orbital Bombardment System (and with a glider), deploying MIRV, and building hundreds of missile silos.
