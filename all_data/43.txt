Really Farooq? I suppose they thrashed us in Kargil, there was no surgical strike or air strike. FAFT grey listing is just a minor irritant. As for nuclear weapons, Pak will make unilateral decisions, right, Farooq? ; #UPDATE : üö® Indian Government should talk with Pakistani Government because Pakistan is an emerging superpower with more nuclear weapons than us and it's very hard for us to win war with them!! ~ Farooq Abdullah #JammuAndKashmir	Á©∫Ë¢≠/ËΩ∞ÁÇ∏
