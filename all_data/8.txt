The coup attempt was a partisan attack, only GOP participated. So of course these traitors don't want to be exposed and will do everything in their power to escape justice ; Instead of joining across party lines to get to the bottom of a violent attack on our democracy, the GOP is treating an insurrection as a partisan matter. Pelosi was right to nix Banks & Jordan who would have tried to sabotage a fair inquiry. My column	政变
