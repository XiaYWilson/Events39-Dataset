Learn about the protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts in this excerpt from the 4th edition of “The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law”	武装冲突
The lack of legitimacy and accountability are at the root of many of Africa’s armed conflicts, reflecting an inability of these political systems to accommodate participation, contestation, and power-sharing. ; Repressive and autocratic governments are more likely to face instability that democratic ones. When people—even those who disagree with the ruling elite—are allowed to express themselves peacefully, they are less likely to turn to non-peaceful means.	武装冲突
