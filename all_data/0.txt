Skilled migrants have started leaving New Zealand. Read fourth story in last few days- a Mechanical Engineer from South Africa, two medical doctors from Europe, a Finance Manager from India. Reason- anti-immigrant policy of the Government.	难民
That's ridiculous it's the English channel, for crying out loud . If you can't patrol such a small area you are not fit to Govern England The whole Turkish Indian Conservative party should step down And Macron also held accountable for failure to implement EU immigrant policy ; As the invasion continues @pritipatel… Sunbathers in Kent, England, confronted by a boat load of illegal immigrants who bypassed border forces and landed on the beach!

@koreanforeigner And your argument based on the role of ROK military doesn't make sense either. ROK military stayed as part of international security assistance force during the period of 2010 and 2014. Afghan refugee crisis happened because of Americans' botched exit strategy, not stabilization.	难民
@BreitbartNews Orchestrated to create another refugee crisis for the sole purpose of changing the racial makeup of Western countries.	难民

[Editorial] The refugee crisis is real and poses a serious burden not only in terms of hosting refugees, but also managing their constant cross-border movement.	难民
Anyone find it strange that @LozzaFox preaches all lives matter at any given moment, but when there's an actual current refugee crisis (i.e Afghanistan) he's amazingly quiet on those lives mattering.... ; Night, night Twatter. All Iives matter.	难民
@Piroshaliso @lukemcgee @GreyLava @EricBoehlert Europe doesn't want a refugee crisis on it's hands. There was the same desire to exit Afghanistan that the US had but the consequences of a messy exit have far more direct repercussions on Europe. Foreign policy also matters more to European voters than it does to US voters.	难民
Of course he will….an information war he has been using to his advantage for years by willing useful idiots Farage/Banks etc…so don’t be fooled. ; Confirmed: Putin to use Afghan refugee crisis for Information Warfare on EU/UK.	难民
Fuck Yeah, we discussed Mental Health in the class today. Boys and girls were so thoughtful about it. Village issues were discussed. Joblessness and insecurities affecting families and being a migrant, all came into the discussion. Refugee crisis was the breakthrough discussion	难民
@nytimes Obama was responsible for the Syrian refugee crisis that hit Europe by walking away from his red line. Now it’s Biden’s turn. Bad planning or no planning and another refugee crisis. Go Dems.	难民
@AdamMakesTTRPG imo, LMoP has better design on a small-scale (Cragmaw Hideout is still a standout) whereas DoIP's larger-scale structure is cooler (a step in the right direction, not quite there). DoIP's plot as written is horrid though. It's about a refugee crisis but you fight the refugees?	难民
I think much of the Foreign policy community, including top-tier media, share Ryan Crocker's analysis: A stalemate with limited combat deaths is better than acknowledging defeat, prevents a refugee crisis and preserves a minimum level of civil rights for women and minorities. ; I honestly do not understand the mainstream media's analysis that Biden failed in Afghanistan. He's doing what the public wants & the the US was losing the war. Here's @CNN's front page this morning	难民
@GermanGuy001 Neuschwanstein Castle, Berlin/Berlin Wall, The Alps, The autobahn. I know Germany has a pretty good investment in renewable energy. They've taken the refugee crisis seriously. It's next to Austria. German guys are hot- what else do I need to know. 😜	难民

Unbelievable that the #AfghanEvac is presented as some sort of solution. Refugee crisis will only get bigger and bigger as the #Taliban solidifies its rule and the West refuses to establish a safe zone in the #Panjshir area, as I’ve reocmmended since the #AfghanResistance began ; Talibs aren't allowing food & fuel to get into Andarab valley. The humanitarian situation is dire. Thousands of women & children have fled to mountains. Since the last two days Talibs abduct children & elderly and use them as shields to move around or do house search.	难民
🇵🇱/🇧🇾 border refugee crisis: 32 Afghan refugees (incl. women) are now reportedly in life-threatening condition, need immediate medical help.

@GuthrieGF I’m an atheist and I’m very disappointed that the USA doesn’t allow citizens to host refugee families.	难民
@Jessassin @docm77 Following that, there will be border crisises as well off countries will continue to be unwelcoming to others. The rhetoric they use for these people will be the same as any other refugee crisis. To counter that, rhetoric is needed to refute that outright; We need to help people.	难民
@ABC Knew we were going to have another refugee crisis.	难民
I recently started reading Reign of Terror, as directed by the Twitter hive mind, so reporting on this hearing and the 9/11-centric arguments against a pro-immigrant policy really hit different.	难民
Had Afghan men ‘work’ for me and they were the laziest, most unskilled people I have ever met. Their entire focus was gaming the system and most would say they were wanting to go back to Germany because they offer the best benefits and housing. ; One of the lessons that Europe learned during the refugee crisis was that AFGHAN MEN were responsible for a huge number of gang rapes in public. In broad daylight. The Afghans are so barbarous that 6 EU countries automatically deport them.	难民
Ottawa caught flat-footed at start of #COVID19Pandemic & still bungling it’s way through. Now Afghanistan refugee crisis in which preoccupation with Red Tape likely to cost thousands of lives.

I mean, even if you think the West has washed its hands of the place, it’s still surrounded by aspiring regional hegemons and is about to be the source of a refugee crisis. Even Vietnam was invaded by China in 79. End. Pfft.	难民
#BreakingNews Senior German politicians have raised the alarm about another refugee crisis if the West does not fund regional camps. The German journalists’ association has also appealed for the rescue of Afghan reporters.	难民
Like giving the role of Santa Claus to Hitler. Worst choice of person to be in charge of immigration during a humanitarian crisis. @pritipatel @Conservatives @BorisJohnson @10DowningStreet ; Patel implies that the rest of the world just need to pull their weight on refugees. The last major refugee crisis was Syria. Syrians accepted by country were.. 🇹🇷 3.7 million 🇱🇧 855,000 🇯🇴 670,000 🇩🇪 788,000 🇸🇪 173,000 🇳🇱 87,000 🇬🇧 20,000 We are one of the bad guys.	难民
Read this thread if you are one of those who goes red in the face talking about Europe's refugee crisis. ; #Pakistan is expecting 800,000 Afghan #refugees to arrive in country in coming days. Pakistan is already ‘hosting’ 3 million Afghan refugees. The Afghan refugee crisis, a human rights crisis, will of course be framed as ‘Europe’s refugee crisis’ just as Syrian crisis is/was.	难民
We went from the Migrant Crisis of 2021 to the Refugee Crisis of 2021. Combine the two & the devastation is unprecedented. Gang members coming across but now we're flying in Taliban terrorist sympathies, tendencies, & membership. Consider a run for Office.	难民
#Refugee crisis coming. My guess is that Pakistan will temporarily accept the refugees before they are granted asylum in Europe by ship. Think about the dark times in the 90‘s that women had to suffer through under the #Talibans. There is no alternative. ; Insane. Don’t have any other words. The Kabul Airport.	难民

Afghanistan: US warns Kabul could fall 'within 90 days'. There's also a strong feeling of betrayal among Afghans regarding the US and NATO's withdrawal. The EU is not ready to handle another major migration/refugee crisis.	难民
