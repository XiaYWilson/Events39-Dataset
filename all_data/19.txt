It's worth watching from earlier: @AOC listing off the Fed's estimates of the long-run unemployment rate over the past five years, noting that unemployment is below all of them without any rise in inflation, and Powell agreeing that they got it wrong. More of this from the Dems.	通胀加息
Negative RRR on junk bonds. This is surreal. Another potential catalyst for other duration assets: growth, tech, precious metals. 👊😎 ; This marks the first time on record junk-bond yields have dropped below the rate of inflation.	通胀加息
@MrNaniR @RealNyhiem @psychmommy @b__patient @AccountNewton @TheRealDHR @trendsetstudio @SandyDarity @JohnHMcWhorter @fbt I only watched about an hour into it but after getting schooled on MMT through an analogy that Kelton uses, herself, you still sat there looking dumb.

@GOPLeader Not worried about inflation, Kevin. I am more worried about losing our democracy to Republicans who are anti-vaccine, anti-democracy, and anti-tax on the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Republicans no longer represent average Americans.	通胀加息
1) we'll be cutting incomes just as an inflation spike is pushing up the cost of living. We think inflation could be hitting 4% by the end of the year. That is going to drag on household incomes just as we're hoping the recovery will be getting going - doing this on top = unwise	通胀加息
This is a huge mistake. Twatdope must go. ; For 30 yrs, there was a bipartisan consensus for a 2% “Inflation Control Target”. Finance Ministers Wilson, Martin, Manley, Flaherty, Oliver & Morneau mandated the central bank to hit it. Now Trudeau wants to scrap targets & reignite 12% inflation like his dad.	通胀加息

Let's correct some misinformation coming from Biden. Our economy began its comeback last year June with progress on vaccines & fast tracking production of PPE. Biden inherited a rising economy. Spending trillions didn't do anything to economy except cause inflation to rise ; #Gaslighting President Biden ought to be enjoying an economic boom as lockdowns end. Instead his policies have abetted a spike in inflation that is outstripping gains in wages. via @WSJOpinion	通胀加息

@jstichweh @HouseGOP @RepStefanik The gov prints money to finance spending w/I new taxes, causing inflation. People lose purchasing power because their cash is worth less. Working families are hit harder by inflation b/c most of their assets are in cash. Both Keynes & Friedman agreed that inflation = Taxation.	通胀加息

@seangagen This is a tough question. I think Republicans retake both chambers, but with a slim majority. Major issues for 2022 will be the state of the economy, inflation, jobs, and housing. Additionally, I think how left mainstream culture swings will impact it too. #PMGT6430	通胀加息
