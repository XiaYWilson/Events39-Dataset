Thank you Steve. It’s helpful to understand weather and guide responsible #ClimateAction when meteorologists write/tweet about climate change @ellenbacca @weathermanmark ; Since 1950, nine hurricanes rapidly intensified within 24-hours of making landfall. Six of those happened in the past two decades, four in the past five years. Notice a trend? More heat in our atmosphere & oceans translates to more energy. @WAVY_News	气象灾害
@RyanMaue With 72 hours to landfall, what would you have predicted at that time if you were in charge, knowing what you knew then? The official intensity forecast did lag behind human thinking until after it was too late to spur safe/effective preparatory action that major tag elicits.	气象灾害
