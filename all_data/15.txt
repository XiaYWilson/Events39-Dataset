@CNNBusiness S&P 500 hits fresh intraday record after Fed minutes show timeline for slowing on stimulus may be shorter (Note:-> no move to taper asset purchases seems imminent.)	股市指数
TIL: • The US is a state run economy; • The S&P 500’s outlook is comparable to the German CDAX post-WW2; • Blackstone’s share price is up because they’ve bought up middle income homes; and • FANG companies face a lack of anti monopoly regulation. Excellent thread. ; A thread on what I think happens next. 1/ $3.5 trillion - the Eisenhower-esque amount Yellen/Biden are proposing to spend eclipses the Iraq war and Citigroup 2008 bailout combined by over $1 trillion. We have a 300,000 birth deficit, not a baby boom. What does that mean?	股市指数

Not too invested in protecting Pelosi's wealth but the basic math here is obvious. GG's wildly misleading description of its growth over time is yet another clear sign that he's more invested in spreading a facile anti-Dem narrative than telling complex truths ; This means Pelosi's wealth has risen by 180% since 2004. But the S&P 500 has risen by 275% since then. So if Pelosi had just put her money in an index fund she'd now be worth $146 million, instead of $115 million. Very odd to call underperforming the S&P wildly successful.	股市指数
